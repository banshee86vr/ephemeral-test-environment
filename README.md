## How to use vCluster and Argo Workflow to manage ephemeral test environments

Project structure:

```text
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ argo-workflow
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lang
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hello-world-app
```

- `argo-workflow`: CI/CD pipeline templates
  - `lang`: ArgoWorkflow Templates for supported languages
- `hello-world-app` folder: Go Hello world application that prints a beautiful octopus üêô in ASCII code

Key highlights from the article include:

1. **vCluster Usage**: The article introduces vCluster as a pivotal tool for creating lightweight, ephemeral Kubernetes clusters. It's interesting how vCluster can be employed to instantiate and manage test environments on-demand, covering the scenarios where temporary clusters are essential for testing.

2. **Argo Workflow Implementation**: The article delves into the integration of Argo Workflow, a workflow engine for Kubernetes, providing a way to configure the orchestration of the deployment, testing, and teardown processes efficiently. The tool also enables the final user to define another kind of process drawing DAGs (<https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/walk-through/dag/>). This feature supports complex scenarios where there is a requirement to maximize parallelism when running tasks.
